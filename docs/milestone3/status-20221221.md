# Milestone 3 status per 21 December 2022

## Goal: RPC server, part 1
What we want to achieve is to share calculation (sub-)results between C++ applications
running at the same time, on the same machine.

This will be realized by introducing a central RPC server, that
resolves requests on behalf of a number of clients (C++ applications, WebSocket server).
The server's caches are logically shared between clients: if client X needs a (sub-)result
that was already calculated and cached for client Y, then it will immediately get
the cached result; it need not be recalculated.

## Achievements
### Resolve technical debt
* Remove obsolete / experimental requests code
* Issue #230 (fix configuration parsing)
* Improve resolving serialized requests: generalize dependency on `thinknode_request_context`

## Next
* Resolve more technical debt if necessary (perhaps serialization method?)
* Shared memory between apps and server
