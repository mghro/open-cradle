// For Windows, it uses SHGetFolderPath to determine appropriate system-wide
// and user-specific directories for the app and then creates subdirectories
// in there for different purposes. (It is currently biased towards storing
// local data, so it uses the non-roaming user data directory.)
//
// For other systems, it uses the XDG standards.
//
// Note that there is currently no specific implementation for OS X.
